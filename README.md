## üîç Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

EDA was conducted to explore global population trends and distributions across continents. 

### Key Findings:
- **Asia**: Accounts for over 50% of the global population and shows exponential growth.  
- **Africa**: Demonstrates steady population growth, with high birth and fertility rates.  
- **Europe**: Experienced slight population decreases post-2000.  

### Statistical Highlights:
- **HDI**: Most countries analyzed have high HDI, reflecting better living standards.  
- **Fertility Rate**: Right-skewed distribution.  
- **GDP Growth**: Normally distributed, centered around 2.5% to 5%.  

### Visualizations:
The analysis used **bar charts**, **pie charts**, and **line graphs** to illustrate key population trends.

## ü§ñ Model Building and Prediction

### Approach:
The model used **Linear Regression** to predict future population growth. To ensure feature stability and independence, the following techniques were applied:
- **Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE)**  
- **Variance Inflation Factor (VIF)**  

### Selected Features:
1. **HI_Avg_4decades**  
2. **Fertility rate**  
3. **BirthToDeathRatio**  
4. **SexRatioAllAges**  
5. **GDP growth (10-year average)**  
6. **World Population Percentage**

### Model Performance:
- **R¬≤ Score**: Achieved an impressive score of **99%**, indicating excellent model accuracy.  
- **Residual Analysis**: Residuals showed slight distortion at the mean, which may require further optimization.

## üìà Results and Insights

### Key Takeaways:
1. **Fertility and Birth Rates**: High values in these metrics are strong predictors of rapid population growth (e.g., Niger).  
2. **Economic Factors**: GDP growth significantly influences regional population stability.  
3. **Demographic Diversity**: Asia dominates population concentration, while Africa leads in growth rate.  
4. **Data Gaps**: Some regions (e.g., American Samoa) lacked sufficient data, affecting model robustness.

## üèÅ Conclusion

This project provides a comprehensive understanding of global population dynamics:
- Regions with high birth and fertility rates experience rapid growth.
- Economic stability, as indicated by GDP growth, correlates with slower population increases.  

### Future Directions:
- **Timeseries Forecasting Models**: To improve predictive accuracy by incorporating socioeconomic and environmental factors.  
- **Broader Data Coverage**: Include additional datasets to account for unrepresented regions.
